# Spigot (1.20.6) & Skyblock (2.1) Server
Installation Steps:
- `java -jar BuildTools.jar`
- `./start`
- Sign eula.txt
- `./start`
- Whitelist yourself, and your friends, then join and add to custom groups (Check Essentials plugins for config)

### How to add Users to groups
`/lp user/group <user|group> parent set <group> [context...]`

### Plugin notes
Clearlag, EssentialsX/EssentialsXChat, LuckPerms, and Vault are all for server upkeep

LuckPerms handle permissions - should be simple as ever, everyone has very limited capabilities

Minepacks: Configurable backpacks
- lp group default permission set backpack.use true

VeinMiner: Saves players time mining
- lp group default permission set veinminer.veinminer.* true

BetterChairs: Chairs man
- "Every stair, every half block or even every block can be a chair if you want it to!"

TeePeeRequests: Good ol' tpa

BreweryX: Get drunk
- TODO: Setup config
